Title: About

I am a Ph.D.-trained experimental fluid dynamicist turned data scientist. However, in many ways that isn't much of a change since both areas are heavily dependent on data mining.
Sometimes, I can be found outside rock climbing or mountaineering but mostly I can be found enthusiastically programming and ogling data.


The purpose of this website is to document my post-Ph.D. adventures in data science. 
I sincerely hope that I can help other data science folks through my posts as well as give a taste of some of the work that I do.
Feel free to contact me at any time if you would like to connect or if there is something I can help you with. 
My current email address is on the top of my CV.
